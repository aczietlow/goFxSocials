## Notes for self


Twitter
fx/vx - add either fx or vx right before 'twitter' to embed the video or images! They both have slightly different looks, so see which you prefer.
X (gonna give it to ya)
Fix vX - If we're ever forced to use x.com, stick fixv in front of the x.
TikTok
vxTikTok - put vx in front of tiktok.
Reddit
vxReddit - get rid of that fake play button by putting vx in front of reddit!
Instagram
Insta Fix - put dd in front of Instagram. This doesn't work 100% of the time, sometimes it only works on popular videos.
